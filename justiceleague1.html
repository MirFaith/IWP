    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">SYNOPSIS</span></h5>
	<p>"Justice League" is undeniably one of the largest movie titles of 2017, but despite being huge, it is approached at very hesitantly especially after the let-downs that were "Batman v Superman" and "Suicide Squad". Luckily, "Wonder Woman" managed to set everything right and prove that the DC franchise can still produce good movies. But is "Justice League" one of them? We think that the movie lies in the borderline between good and great. </p>
	<p>Basically, the movie is a typical superhero flick. It's a simple and fun popcorn movie with great effects, great action and of course great acting. However, do note that there is no depth, no twist or turns, and no emotional drama (like "Batman v Superman), so there is nothing from this movie that requires you to use extensive cognitive ability. The movie starts off by introducing a new villain, Steppenwolf, that has showed up, and who plans to take over the world - so pretty much like every other villain out there. Then we are introduced to each of the superheroes and a bit of their backstories, and how Batman and Wonder Woman end up recruiting the others.</p>
	<p>Of course not all heroes decide to jump on board immediately; there are some complications and conditions on their end, so there is some drama going on in between, particularly with Cyborg. 
Speaking of Cyborg (played by newcomer Ray Fisher), while it is understandable that his character was supposed to be the cool, rebellious type of teen, he is very forgettable. Sometimes it feels as though that his character was there just to fill in some extra gaps in the story.
</p>
	<p>Barry Allen a.k.a. The Flash (played by Ezra Miller) is basically the Spiderman of Justice League. He is the comical element of the movie whose purpose is to ease up on all the tension. As a comic relief, Miller does a really good job. He's cute and fun to watch, and most importantly, his brand of comedy works.
Aquaman on the other hand, is so hot! Jason Momoa really rocks his long hair and beard, and his portrayal as the character shows that Aquaman is more than just a lame merman who talks to fish
</p>
	<p>Not much is there to say about Batman and Wonder Woman because their characters have remained the same if you have watched the previous DC movies. Gal Gadot has this strong and independent feminine charm that draws you towards her no matter what she does, while Ben Affleck may not be the best Batman in the DC Universe, but he delivers his part to the story well.If you watched the trailer then you know that Henry Cavill returns as Superman, but the less is said about his return the better. Overall, "Justice League" is a fun and exciting movie about a team of superheroes saving the world, but that's all there is to it. No deep underlying meanings here.</p>
